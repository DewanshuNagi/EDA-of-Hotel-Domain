Overview
Welcome to the Hotel Data Analysis Project! This project leverages real-world hotel datasets to extract valuable insights into hotel performance, customer behavior, and booking trends. By cleaning, transforming, and merging the data, we can uncover patterns and create actionable visualizations that highlight key aspects of the hospitality industry.

Through this project, you'll see how data wrangling and analysis in Python can turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Key Features
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset is clean and reliable.
2. Data Merging: Combine multiple datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within the hotel data.
4. Data Visualization: Use powerful Python libraries to create insightful and visually appealing charts and graphs.

Technologies Used
1. Python: The programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
2. Pandas: The powerhouse for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
3. Matplotlib: For creating static, dynamic, and interactive visualizations.
4. Seaborn: A data visualization library built on Matplotlib that makes it easier to create attractive and informative statistical graphics.
5. Numpy: Used for numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.
6. Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and visualizations.

 Key Insights
Throughout the data analysis, we uncovered several key insights related to hotel performance and occupancy. Some of the most notable findings include:
1. Monthly Revenue Realized: Analyzed the total revenue realized by the hotel on a monthly basis, providing a clear view of revenue trends throughout the year.
2. June Occupancy Percentage (Mean): Found that the average occupancy percentage in June is one of the highest for the year, showcasing a peak in hotel bookings during this month.
3. Weekday vs Weekend Occupancy: We observed significant differences between weekday and weekend occupancy rates. By calculating the mean occupancy percentage for both periods, we identified that weekends tend to have a higher occupancy, likely due to increased leisure travel.
4. City Occupancy Percentage (Mean): Analyzed the occupancy percentage across various cities and found that certain cities consistently show higher mean occupancy rates, revealing potential market trends and demand factors.
5. Room Class Occupancy Percentage (Mean): Calculated the average occupancy percentage for each room class, which helped identify which types of rooms were in higher demand and which were underutilized.

Visualizations
In this project, several visualizations were created to illustrate key insights and patterns in the hotel data. Some of the notable visualizations include:
1. Booking Value: A visualization showing the total booking value over time, helping to understand how hotel revenue fluctuates and identifying peak booking periods.
2. City Value: A chart illustrating the total booking or revenue values by city, which highlights which cities contribute the most to hotel bookings and revenue generation.
3. Room Class Occupancy Percentage (Mean): A plot showing the mean occupancy percentage for each room class, offering a clear picture of which room types are in higher demand and which might need strategic pricing adjustments.
4. City Occupancy Percentage (Mean): A visualization showing the mean occupancy percentage for hotels in various cities, helping to identify trends and demand patterns across different geographical locations.
5. These visualizations allow us to quickly grasp key trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize hotel operations.

 How We Analyzed the Data
1. Data Importing: Loaded datasets using Python's powerful Pandas library.
2. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new columns to enrich the dataset for deeper analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and trends using statistical methods and visualizations.
5. Visualization: Crafted interactive plots and insightful charts to convey data stories effectively.

Conclusion
This project provides an insightful exploration of hotel industry data, focusing on cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing the data to extract valuable insights.
